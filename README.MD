This project is a basic counter. It was written only using HTML, CSS, and vanilla Javascript.

This project is heavily based on John Smilga's Color Flipper project on his HTML/CSS/JS course ([Codding Addict](https://www.youtube.com/c/codingaddict)
). But it might have a few or a lot of tweaks and new things added by me.

# Project Features

-   Increase, decrease or reset the counter;
-   Clicking to reset the counter opens a dialog box for confirmation;
-   Counter value changes based if the value is positive, negative or zero;
-   An easter egg...
